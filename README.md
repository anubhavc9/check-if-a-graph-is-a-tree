# check-if-a-graph-is-minimally-connected
C program to check if an undirected graph is minimally connected
A graph is minimally connected if and only if it is a tree i.e. there are no cycles & the graph is connected
# Usage:
This is a menu-driven program which uses the linked list implementation of adjacency lists
